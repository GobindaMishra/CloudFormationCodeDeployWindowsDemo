# CloudFormationCodeDeployWindowsDemo
Cloudformation and Code Deploy demo for windows.  

This is a demonstration on using Cloudformation/CodePipeline/CodeDeploy for deploying a .NETCore 2.0 web application to the Amazon cloud via AWS.  I had this finished a few weeks back but wanted to clean up the scripts before I made them available.

Parts 1 and 2 of the youtube videos demonstrating and going thru these scripts can be found here:
